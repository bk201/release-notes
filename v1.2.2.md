Harvester can be installed using the [ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.2/install/index), a [bootable USB drive](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.2/install/usb-install), and [PXE boot](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.2/install/pxe-boot-install). For more information, see the [Installation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.2/install/requirements) section of the documentation.

## Upgrade

Harvester only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrading Harvester](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.2/upgrade/index).

> [!NOTE]
